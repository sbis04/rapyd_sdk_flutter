# Rapyd Flutter SDK

This is an **UNOFFICIAL** Flutter SDK for using [Rapyd APIs](https://docs.rapyd.net/build-with-rapyd/reference/api-reference) in Dart/Flutter apps.

> ðŸš§ **WIP (Disclaimer):** This package is in very early stage of development and has limited APIs to interact with. Feel free to contribute to this project as much as possible to make it production ready as soon as possible.

## Installation

Add this to your package's `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  version: ^0.1.1
```

You can install packages from the command line:

```bash
pub get rapyd
```

## Usage

You can checkout the comprehensive example present in the [`example`](example/example.dart) folder.

Following is a simple example of initializing a Rapyd Client and creating a new user using this SDK:

```dart
// Initializing
final rapydClient = RapydClient('<access_key>', '<secret_key>');

try {
  // Creating a new customer
  final customer = await rapydClient.createNewCustomer(
    email: 'example@name.com',
    name: 'User',
  );
  print('Created customer successfully, ID: ${customer.data.id}');
} catch (e) {
  print('ERROR: ${e.toString()}');
}
```
